"""Build the Music School artifact — one self-contained HTML page from the vault.

Reads the curriculum notes (classes, courses, concepts), School Config, syllabus.json
and progress-<user>.json, and writes school.html beside this file. That file is what
`Artifact` publishes; the published page then writes its own progress back to itself
via the `artifact` capability, and `/school sync` pulls it home.

Re-run after ANY edit to a course/class/concept note — the page is a generated bundle,
never hand-edited (same rule as the plugin's main.js).

ONE PAGE PER PERSON. The curriculum is shared; progress is not. --user picks whose
progress-<user>.json seeds the page, and --out keeps the two builds in separate files so they
publish as separate artifacts. Never publish two people from one file path.

    Fixing it in the notes was the wrong lever (251 files, and the next note typed re-breaks it)
    and dropping `sane_lists` was too blunt — it guards the mid-sentence-hyphen case that this
    corpus, full of em-dashed prose, would trip constantly. So the blank line is inserted at
    RENDER time, for exactly the shape that is unambiguous.

    Four guards, each ruling out a place where the insert would change meaning rather than fix it:
      · fenced code — a `- ` there is content, and a blank line inside a fence is a blank line;
      · an INDENTED predecessor — that is a lazy continuation or a nested list, and breaking there
        turns a tight list loose (every item wrapped in its own `<p>`) for no reason;
      · a predecessor that is itself a list item — same list, already fine;
      · a heading, blockquote or table row — markdown already starts a list after all three.

# stay in the note itself: school-course-lint.py's header-order check requires it between
# "**What it assumes**" and "**What this unlocks**", and cross-checks each row's title and
# concept count against the ### Lesson heading and frontmatter. So it is stripped here, at
# render time, out of the page only -- the note on disk (and the lint) are untouched.
#
# STILL LOAD-BEARING after spec-172. Every course 01-16 and 19-26 opens with one of these
# tables and the lint requires it, so the strip stays. It remains scoped to the course
# INTRO only (see the COURSES loop), so a similarly-shaped table written inside a later

# ---------------------------------------------------------- reading material (PATCH-010)
# A lesson's **Read** block is a list of pointers into the textbook:
#
#     - [ ] [[Notes & Pitches]] → *Sharps & flats*, *Half-steps & whole-steps*
#     - [ ] [[INTERVALS]] → the table, top to bottom
#     - [ ] [[Scales]] in full — it's 65 lines
#
# Those notes live in the vault, not in this page, so on the published artifact every Read
# line was dead text and the reading step could not actually be done there. This block pulls
# the named material INTO the bundle: the link resolves to a note, the `→` suffix resolves to
# one or more headings inside it, and the heading's subtree is rendered to HTML and parked in
# a shared pool that app.js folds in under the task line.
#
# Three rules keep this honest and keep the page small:
#   1. NOTHING here may raise. Every failure degrades to a coarser pull and, at worst, to
#      today's behaviour -- the link on its own. Misses are counted and printed, never fatal.
#   2. Pull SECTIONS, not notes, wherever a section is named. All 72 notes wholesale is
#      1,481 KB of markdown; the named sections are 90 KB of it.
#   3. Drop the enrichment tail. `## From videos` is /music-enrich's video digest and is
#      1,069 KB of that 1,481 KB across these notes -- 72% of the corpus, none of it the
#      assigned reading. `Related` / `See also` are link lists that render as dead
#      xlink-vault spans here. Both come out of whole-note pulls; a section pull that names
#      one of them by heading still gets it.

# PATCH-053 made the note name on a Read line open the ASSIGNED SLICE in place, because that
# slice was the only part of the note this page carried. Nate, 2026-08-26: *"i want those links
# to go to the actual page instead of just expanding the section below. i like how it is now but
# want the link to go to the actual page so i can get more info if i want."*
#
# So the fold stays exactly as it is — it is the assigned reading and it opens without leaving
# the lesson — and the note name beside it becomes what it always looked like: a link to the
# note. That note now has a page in this bundle. Same three constraints as PATCH-010:
#
#   1. Only notes something in the school actually ASSIGNS get a page. The nine reading roots
#      hold 3,635 notes and 24 MB of teaching body; the 73 that a **Read** line points at are
#      375 KB of it. A page for every note in the vault is not a bigger feature, it is a
#      different bundle.
#   2. The enrichment tail stays out, for the same reason it stays out of a whole-note pull —
#      `## From videos` is 72% of this corpus and none of it is the note. The page SAYS how
#      many sections it is not showing, so "the rest is in the vault" is a fact you can see
#      rather than something the page quietly decides for you.
#   3. Nothing here may raise. A note that will not load has no page, and its link stays the
#      inert span it is today.

# ------------------------------------------------------------ the books (spec-172)
# Six of the eight new courses are one exercise of a scanned book per lesson, and a page
# number is not a lesson: the point of this block is that the page itself is IN the page,
# so the exercise can be read where it is assigned instead of "go open the PDF".
#
# THE TWO BOOKS DO NOT NUMBER THEIR PAGES THE SAME WAY, and that is the trap in this block.
# A course's `Pages` column says what a lesson cites; `folios` says how to turn one of those
# numbers into a page of the PDF. Hanon cites the scan's own 1-116 index, so it has no map.
# Leavitt's courses cite the BOOK'S OWN PRINTED FOLIOS (Course 25 says so in its own text),
# and the scan's index runs ahead of them by an amount that CHANGES twice — feeding a folio
# straight to the renderer there returns the wrong page, and wrongly by a varying amount.
#
# Leavitt's copyright gate was withdrawn by Nate on 2026-08-20 (*"disregard the copywright
# gate for levitt"*) — he owns the book and the artifact is private. That is a decision about
# THIS page being private, not a licence to redistribute: if the school page is ever made
# public, this entry comes back out.
#
# 127 PDF pages against a 123-page book plus four leaves of front matter, and TWO printed
# pages are absent from the scan, so the gap closes in two steps rather than one:
#
#     folios   3-14   -> PDF folio+2      (PDF 5 is folio 3, "SECTION ONE")
#     folio    15     -> ABSENT (Sharps and Flats)
#     folios  16-33   -> PDF folio+1      (PDF 17 is folio 16, "Here We Go Again")
#     folio    34     -> ABSENT (Another Duet in G)
#     folios  35-126  -> PDF folio        (PDF 35 is folio 35, "Key of F")
#
# Verified by RENDERING the pages and reading the printed titles off them against the book's
# own Contents (PDF 4, which lists every piece with its folio) — not by arithmetic. Pinned on
# both sides of both steps: 14/16 and 33/35, plus 27, 28, 30, 32, 50, 94, 118, 122 and the
# index, which the Contents itself says is on p. 126 and which is PDF 126. The scans carry no
# printed page number at all — the raster is cropped tight to the ink — so the titles and the
# Contents are the only ground truth there is. 2026-08-20.

# Nate, 2026-09-01, a link drop of ~30 outside sites, apps, textbooks, articles and playlists:

# means something else in this build -- PATCH-145, the files Nate uploads against an OUTSIDE
# lesson, keyed by lesson-note name and cached under `Machine/School/lesson-resources/`. Two
# meanings for one word inside one page is how a later reader wires the wrong one.

# creating a visual page that has song titles with their photos where the user can click into the
# song to see details. will add them to the practice/learning system afterwards. for now just want
# the library in there to reference."*
#
# So this is a SHELF, and the sentence above is the spec: nothing here is assigned, due, scheduled
# or scored, and nothing on this page writes progress. It sits in the rail's Library group for
# exactly the reason PATCH-111 gives — it would look identical on a vault that never started a
# course. The practice/learning wiring is a LATER spec; leaving the hooks out is the point, not an
# omission (a half-wired song that shows a due date nothing computes is worse than no wiring).
#
# Three pieces, carried by three different mechanisms on purpose:
#
#   · SONGS   — the frontmatter. ~30 KB, rides inside CURRICULUM because the grid needs all of it
#               at once to filter and sort, and it is too small to be worth a decision.
#   · the body — parked through `_source()`, the SAME function a **Read** line uses. There is no
#               second markdown path here (PATCH-144's rule), the detail page IS `sourceView` with
#               a header bolted on, and the side effect is worth as much as the page: `_source`
#               registers each note's basename in SRC_INDEX, so every `[[🎵 ARTIST - Title]]`
#               already written across the school becomes a live link the moment this ships.
#   · COVERS  — base64 webp, in an island of its own like the book scans, because it is the one
#               part that is measured in megabytes and the one part `lite` may have to leave
#               behind. app.js renders a typographic tile wherever a cover is missing, so a build
#               without the island is a page that still works.

# can you embed them in the page directly?"*
#
# THE EMBED QUESTION IS NOW CLOSED, BY OBSERVATION RATHER THAN INFERENCE. spec-174's Phase 0 note
# recorded that the CSP verdict rested on the Artifact tool's documented contract because the
# Chrome bridge was unavailable, and asked the next person to run a live click-test. That test was
# run 2026-09-02 against a throwaway published artifact, and the page's own
# `securitypolicyviolation` handler caught both frames:
#
#     directive=frame-src  blocked=https://www.soundslice.com
#     directive=frame-src  blocked=https://www.youtube.com
#     ... form-action 'self'; frame-src 'self' blob: data:; object-src 'none'; ...
#
# `frame-src 'self' blob: data:`. No external host, no carve-out, nothing to negotiate: a
# Soundslice iframe inside this page is dead, and so is every other embed. The link-out is not a
# preference any more, it is the only thing that works.
#
# WHAT WE CAN DO INSTEAD is carry everything ABOUT the slice into the page, so the shelf is
# readable before you leave it. The slice pages are public and carry two useful strings: the real
# <title> (Nate's hand-typed label said "Harmonic minor chord scale"; the slice itself says
# "D Harmonic minor worksheet" -- the key was missing) and an og:description that is the teacher's
# own written brief ("Played in 4th position ... particular attention to triplets (25bpm)"), which
# appears NOWHERE in the vault note. That is metadata about the assignment, not the score, so the
# README's do-not-mirror rule is untouched.

# ------------------------------------------------- lesson resources (PATCH-145, 2026-08-26)
# Nate: *"for outside lesson entries. i want the ability to upload resources - usually related
# to homework. is that possible? if i cant upload in the artifact i can add elsewehre."*
#
# NOT IN THE PAGE, AND THAT IS SETTLED. The artifact runtime serves this account four
# capabilities — `artifact`, `downloads`, `mcp`, `self` — and none of them is file storage.
# The one thing that could be made to work (read the file to a data: URI, then `publish()` the
# whole document with it inside) fails three separate ways, so it is not a fallback, it is a
# trap: every `build.py` run regenerates school.html from the vault and would erase it; the
# Obsidian plugin's stubbed `publish()` keeps only the progress island and drops the rest; and
# the full bundle is already 10.4 MB of a 16 MB ceiling.
#
# So the vault is the upload surface — which is also the one that works OFFLINE, where a
# page-side upload never could. Two ways to attach a file, both checked here:
#
#   1. `Lessons/Resources/<the lesson note's filename>/` — everything in that folder.
#      Its `capture_id` works as the folder name too, for a page-captured lesson.
#   2. A file sitting directly in `Lessons/Resources/` whose name starts with the lesson's
#      DATE — `2026-08-26 barre chords.pdf`. This is the drop-it-in-from-the-phone path: one
#      folder, no subfolder to create, and the date is already how these notes are named.
#
# A file that matches neither is REPORTED, never silently ignored — an attachment that does
# not appear is indistinguishable from one nobody added, and that is the failure mode this
# whole block exists to avoid.

# Nate: *"guitar positions isnt linked on the page. make sure all links work in the school
# system."*
#
# PATCH-144's rule was "only notes something in the school ASSIGNS get a page", and that rule is
# exactly why [[Guitar Positions]] read as dead grey text: it is named 13 times -- from the
# Interval Ladder drill, from lesson prose, from inside pulled reading -- and assigned by no
# **Read** line anywhere. Measured on the build this replaced: 4,550 vault spans on the page,
# 2,113 of them live, 2,437 dead across 779 distinct note names.
#
# THE WHOLE CLOSURE DOES NOT FIT, AND NO CAP MAKES IT FIT. Following every link out of every page
# the bundle already has reaches 434 notes at hop 1, another 1,010 at hop 2, and 4,745 at
# fixpoint -- 5.4 MB of rendered HTML for hop 1 ALONE, on top of an 11.5 MB bundle against a
# 16 MB artifact ceiling. So this pass is deliberately BUDGETED rather than complete, and the
# run prints what it could not reach instead of leaving that to be discovered on the page:
#
#   * HOP BY HOP outward from what is already there, so the reader's first click always lands
#     somewhere real and it is DEPTH that runs out, never the page in front of them;
#   * MOST-LINKED FIRST within a hop, so each byte of the budget buys the most dead spans;
#   * REF_CAP per page, far under an assigned note's 60 KB, because these are reference pages --
#     the opening and the first sections, closed by the same "the rest is in the vault" footer a
#     capped assigned note already prints. A short real page beats a grey span, and beats a
#     bundle that will not publish;
#   * TRANSCRIPTS EXCLUDED. 1,625 of the notes reachable from here are raw auto-caption dumps
#     under `YouTube Notes/Transcripts/`; the lesson note that digests one is in the bundle
#     already, and spending the budget on captions would buy fewer links and worse pages.
#
# The pass runs HERE, after every other section has been built, for two reasons: it has to see
# the spans in DRILLS, TOOLS, SONGS and SLICES as well as the courses, and a note it adds must
# never win over the same note being parked in full by a Read line (`_source` returns early on a
# note that already has a page, so assignment always takes precedence).

# ---------------------------------------------------------- the copyright gate on the BUNDLE
# 2026-09-01, Nate's call. The published artifact is shared with anyone who has the link, so a
# scanned in-copyright book embedded in it is redistribution — and this file has said so about
# Leavitt since the scans went in ("the copyright gate, which exists because Leavitt cannot be
# redistributed"). What that comment described was the gate in app.js — `BOOKPAGES[c.book]`
# returning undefined for an absent book — but nothing ever *applied* it to the published build,
# so all 119 Leavitt pages shipped on every publish from 2026-08-20 onward.
#
# It was also masked: `school-lite.html` was described as "the copyright-clean copy", which made
# it sound like the boundary was handled somewhere. It was not — lite was a second file, and the
# FULL build is what gets published. Retiring lite on 2026-09-01 did not cause this and did not
# fix it; it removed the thing that made it look fixed.
#
# THE SPLIT IS BY COPYRIGHT STATUS, NOT BY SIZE:
#   * hanon   — Charles-Louis Hanon, "The Virtuoso Pianist", 1873. PUBLIC DOMAIN. Ships.
#   * leavitt — William Leavitt, "A Modern Method for Guitar" (Berklee Press). IN COPYRIGHT.
#               Stays in the vault, never in the bundle.
#
# The page needs no change to cope, which is the whole point of the app.js gate: every reader is
# written `bk ? … : []`, so an absent book is a course whose lessons show no page images on a page
# that otherwise works completely. The PDF stays in `Books/` and the offline Obsidian pane reads
# the vault, so nothing is lost locally — only the published copy is thinner.
#
# To add a book here, check its copyright first. Pre-1929 or explicitly licensed only.

# THE LITE BUILD IS GONE — retired 2026-09-01, Nate: *"i think i want to abandon school-lite."*
#
# It had three stated reasons and all three were dead:
#
#   1. **Transport.** PATCH-139 built it because `school-lite.html` had to cross Obsidian Sync's
#      5 MB per-file cap to reach the Boox. Nate retired that on 2026-08-31 (*"stop shipping school
#      through obsidian sync. i wont be using the boox anyways"*) and the 4.6 MB ceiling went with
#      it. The shed ladder it fed — sleeves, then charts, then the whole song library, then the
#      lesson handouts — went overboard cheapest-first to protect a device that is out of service.
#   2. **The shared repo.** The comment here claimed lite was "the only build that could ever ship
#      in the shared repo." **That was already untrue when it was written.** `sync-shared.sh` ships
#      build SOURCES (build.py, app.js, app.css, sync.py), never built HTML, and it excludes
#      `Books/` outright — so Britt clones a vault with no scans in it and her own build comes out
#      copyright-clean on its own. Lite was doing nothing for her.
#   3. **The phone/tablet pane.** The last real one: both offline panes loaded lite on a small
#      device because reading the full bundle killed them there. Nate, 2026-09-01: no one reads the
#      pane on a phone or tablet any more. So it goes.
#
# **The copyright gate did NOT live here and is unaffected.** It is `BOOKPAGES[c.book]` returning
# undefined for any book not in the bundle, with every reader written as `bk ? … : []`. A vault
# without `Books/` produces a scan-free page from this one build, which is exactly what the shared
# repo relies on. Dropping lite removed a second COPY of the page, not the boundary.
#
# If a small-device build is ever wanted again, `emit()` still takes the flags that made lite what
# it was — `emit(path, {}, "lite", RESOURCES, COVERS, charts=CHARTS)` reproduces it in one line.
# What is not coming back is the ladder: it existed to hit a transport cap that no longer exists.

# lint: a standing course should sit in a standing class and vice versa. Flags config drift
# rather than silently propagating it into the page.
